Logging In:

Users access the attendance system by visiting the login page and entering their credentials to authenticate.
Home Page and Calendar:

Upon successful login, users are directed to the home page.
On the right side of the home page, a calendar is displayed.
The calendar automatically selects the default date, which helps filter the exam sessions displayed on the cards.
Exam Session Cards:

The home page shows exam session cards, each representing a specific exam.
The cards display essential details such as the exam name, date, time, and venue.
The cards are dynamically filtered based on the selected date on the calendar, showing only the relevant exam sessions.
Attendance Indicator on Venue Cards:

Next to each venue name on the cards, an indicator is shown.
If all attendance hasn't been taken for the sessions in a particular venue, a red indicator is displayed.
Once attendance has been taken for all sessions in that venue, the red indicator changes to green, indicating completion.
Viewing Session Details:

Users can click on a venue card to view the details of the sessions held at that venue.
Staff Type Tabs and Attendance Count:

Within the session details, staff type tabs are presented, representing different categories of staff members (e.g., invigilators, proctors).
Each staff type tab displays the number of staff members whose attendance hasn't been taken yet.
Marking Attendance:

Users can navigate to the staff type tabs and begin marking attendance for each staff member.
Attendance options (e.g., present, absent) are provided for each staff member, typically using radio buttons or checkboxes.
As attendance is marked for each staff member, the count of pending attendance decreases in real-time.
Error Handling:

Proper error handling and validation mechanisms are in place to handle unexpected scenarios and display clear error messages.
